Program prompts user to enter name of the file that contains 10 integers.
It opens, reads and stores the numbers into a list.
Program will then sort the numbers in the list in ascending and descending orders
Program will then print the sorted lists to an output file along with the 
largest and smallest values in the list.

NOTE: All fixme's are each worth 10 points except for the FIXME1 which is worth 20 points
